# Dynamic-Binary-Search-Tree-Visualization-in-Angular
I developed an Angular project featuring a login system with data stored in cookies and a user form that saves data in local storage. The key feature is a dynamic Binary Search Tree (BST) visualization. Users can input numbers, and the BST is drawn in real-time as the tree structure evolves with each entry, offering an interactive learning tool.
